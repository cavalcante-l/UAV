# Unnamed Aerial Image processing

In Remote Sensing the amount of UAV (Unnamed Aerial Vehical) data are increasing, and we should be able to process it. Well, in this repository you will find some scripts to help processing your orthomosaics (still in progress!). Implemented methods: 
- Visible band normalization,
- Visible Vegetation Indexes,
- Outliers detection and removal,
- Image resample,
- Image clustering, 
- And rasters common tasks (clipping, raster to shapefile)

## Getting Started

The main script is **module_func_raster.py** which contains many of the implemented methods. To understand their usage follow these to scripts: **workflow_p1.py** and **workflow_p2.py**.
